# Part I: Setting up a local dev environment

A very simple approach to getting started is [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube).
Minikube is a single node Kubernetes cluster which should be sufficient for our
use case here.

_Note: Since we only need a working Kubernetes API you could also use any other
cluster you like. I only tested this tutorial on K8S version 1.9.X, 1.10.X and 
1.11.X._

Before you can install Minikube, you need to install the Kubernetes command line
client called `kubectl`. You can get it [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
You need `kubectl` because Minikube will setup a so called `context` during startup.
A `context` is like a pointer and can be very helpful when you need to manage
multiple Kubernetes clusters. You can switch between `contexts` and point to
different clusters. In addition, Helm will also use your `kubectl` config file to
find your minikube cluster...

Once you are done, please follow the instructions on the
[Minikube Github Page](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) and install 
it. Please play attention to the dependencies of Minikube. When you are done,
open a terminal and start Minikube.

```
minikube start
```

```

After starting Minikube, you should check if you can interact with the Kubernetes API:

```
kubectl get nodes
```

```
NAME       STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
minikube   Ready     master    47s       v1.10.0
```

Let's also take a look at the running Pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide --all-namespaces
```

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP           NODE

```

To make this tutorial a little bit more realistic, we will create some
[Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/).
A Namespace is a logical unit which I like to treat as different environments. I have
already prepared some Namespaces for you. To create them, just execute:

```bash
kubectl apply -f part-01/templates/namespaces.yml
```

```
namespace/dev created
namespace/test created
namespace/prod created
namespace/tools created
```

Verify that everything is working as expected:

```
kubectl get namespaces
```

```
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    12m
dev           Active    41s
kube-public   Active    11m
kube-system   Active    12m
prod          Active    41s
test          Active    41s
tools         Active    41s
```

Now you are ready to go on with [Part II](../part-02/README.md).
