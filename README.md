## Introduction

Let's start off by shortly summing up what Helm is good for and why you should use
it. Helm makes your life easier when it comes to managing Kubernetes resources.
It helps you by grouping your resources in so called `Charts` and assigning them
[semantic versions](https://semver.org/). In that way, you can package and
release you resources along with your application. To make this more flexible,
Helm uses a very strong templating framework which is based on
[Go-Template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).

Enough talking. Let's make our hands dirty and start with setting up a local
dev environment.
